sunshine kisses cheeks birds sing melodies hearts full of laughter dancing in joy
tears fall silently hearts heavy with sorrow shadows linger
fury boils inside flames of rage consuming fists clenched tight
the capital of Pakistan is Islamabad
words spat like venom daggers of scorn piercing hearts seething with hatred
giggles fill the air friends skipping hand in hand endless smiles blooming
memories haunt whispers of loss emptiness consumes
The meeting is scheduled for 2pm today
dreams soar high hearts beat in harmony love's warmth surrounds
dreams shattered hopes fade darkness descends
betrayal burns deep trust shattered a tempest of fury unleashed
The table has four legs
alone in the silence pain echoes aching souls mourn
roaring thunder storm clouds gathering anger's tempest raging within
every moment sparkles life's symphony of happiness plays on
The package arrived on time
